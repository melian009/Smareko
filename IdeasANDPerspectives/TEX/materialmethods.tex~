\section{The model and its implementation}

In this section, we describe the computational model, while the
mathematical definitions and further technical details are represented
in the online supporting information.

\subsection{Dynamic landscapes}

We use a spatially explicit multitrophic individual-based model in
patchy and dynamic landcapes with individuals dispersing in a random
geometric network with $N$ patches each containing $J_{i}$
individuals. The number of connections of each patch with other
patches in the network change with time and it is a function of the
fluctuations of the radius driven by random or seasonal dynamics...

\vspace{0.2 in}
Here equation to capture landscape dynamics...
\vspace{0.2 in}

The dynamics are modelled as a discrete...  The state of each patch is
described by occupancy matrix... We simulate a large assemblage of
species for different trophic levels. Thus, there can be several
species at each trophic level and there are several spatially distinct
sites. The trophic levels are resources ($R$), consumers ($H$), and
predators ($P$), thus, we have three distinct metacommunities of
resource, consumers, and predators/parasitoids. To model
spatio-temporal changes in the abundance of these sites, we need to
define dispersal and trophic interaction rules together with
population dynamics....

\subsection{Heterogeneous habitats in dynamic landscapes}

We now move to the idea of discrete and heterogeneous habitats. We do
not associate a priori a value for each patch which determine the
habitat type (refs). Instead, we allow individuals to move under two
scenarios: 1) Dispersal between any two patches occur as a function of
species abundance of the leaving site. In this scenario individuals
only move to connected sites and they only feel the dynamics of the
landscape. This means individuals are not aware of the state of each
site before they disperse (i.e., the number of prey or predators in
each site). We call this the neutral scenario.

In the second scenario dispersal between two patches occur not only to
the connected patches driven by the dynamics of the landscape, but
also because individuals have information of each site and they
disperse with higher probabilitites to the sites that have a low
number of predators and a high number of resources available. Thus,
habitat types are a function of the landscape and predator-prey
dynamics and these two fluctuating mechanisms determine the habitat
quality for the species in the respective patch.

\subsection{Implementation}

This section gives an overview of the implementation of the
simulations, while the technical details are given in the supporting
information. Prior to the simulation, one needs to specify the
parameters for generating the landscape and the regional pool of
species for each trophic level. The landscape is generated following
the random geometric networks... The set of species is
characterized... Simulations were initiated with all the patches
occupied by... As there is no colonisation from outside, the model is
an absorbing Markov chain and eventually all species reach extinction
as time goes to infinity. However, before extinction, a species... For
the parameter combinations used in this study... All simulations were
first run for a fixed number of time steps...

\subsection{Computing SAR, turnover rate and food web complexity}

SAR, turnover rates and food web complexity for several rates of
change of the landscape and habitat heterogeneity were recorded by
counting the number of species in each patch (area)... In the case of
our simulation results, we counted...


\begin{comment}
%We consider two models of dispersal between
%sites. Model 1 assumes that dispersal between any two sites occurs
%only between the neighboors and it is density-independent in the sense
%that dispersal probabilities are a function of species abundance of
%the leaving site. Model 1 also assumes that resources, consumers and
%predators move independently of each other. This means individuals are
%not aware of the state of each site before the disperse (i.e., the
%number of prey or predators in each site). Dispersal to the neighboors
%is also occuring in the model 2, but now individuals have information
%of each site and they disperse with higher probabilities to the sites
%that have a low number of predators and a high number of resources
%available.

% This model can help to simulate how changes of environmental control
% mechanisms can affect those ecological relationships and to describe
% it we will use some descriptions as defined in Table 1.

\subsubsection{Model 1: Dispersal dynamics in non-informed landscapes}

Our first model assumes an individual that emigrates moves with
probability inversely proportional to the distance between the
original and the receiving sites and to the carrying capacity of the
receiving site. Thus, individual movement is independent of the state
of each receiving site. This means individuals do not know the number
of resources or predators before the emigration. This leads to the
dispersal rate of species $k_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ in metacommunity
$\mathcal{\phi}$ from site $j$ to site $i$ (where $\mathcal{\phi}$
stands either for the basal ($R$), intermediate ($I$), or top predator
metacommunity ($P$))

\begin{equation}
  m^{k_{\phi}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathcal{K}^{k_{\phi}}_{i} m_{\phi}}{d_{ij}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{K}^{k_{\phi}}_{i}$, $m_{\phi}$, $d_{ij}$ are the
carrying capacity of the receiving site $i$ of metacommunity $\phi$,
the background emigration rate of metacommunity $\phi$, and the
geographical effective distance between site $j$ and site $i$,
respectively.
 
Given the dispersal rate, the number of individuals of species $k$ in
metacommunity $\phi$ that move from site $j$ to site $i$ is
\begin{equation}
  N^{k_{\phi}}_{ij} =  m^{k_{\phi}}_{ij}  N^{k_{\phi}}_{j},
\end{equation}
where $N^{k_{\phi}}_{j}$ is the abundance of species $k$ in site $j$.

%\begin{equation}
%\vspace{0.25cm}
%\small{M(i,j) = \overbrace{ \left[ \lambda^{i} \frac{ \Delta_{ij}\,f\,\Theta \left(\Delta_{ij}\,f\,\right) }{ \sum_{k \in Neigh\left(i\right)}\Delta_{ik}\,f\,\Theta \left(\Delta_{ik}\,f\,\right) }\right]}^{Biotic} \overbrace{\left[w_{ij} \frac{ \Delta_{ij}\,f_{\eta}\,\Theta \left(\Delta_{ij}\,f_{\eta}\,\right) }{ \sum_{k \in Neigh\left(i\right)}\Delta_{ik}\,f_{\eta}\,\Theta \left(\Delta_{ik}\,f_{\eta}\,\right) }\right]}^{Abiotic}}

%$m_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ is the metacommunity-specific background
%dispersal rate (we need here a figure with the landscape considered
%and we also need to simplify the flow chart and explain this model).

\subsubsection{Model 2: Predator-prey ratio dispesal dynamics in informed landscapes}

Our second model assumes the dispersal rates are density-dependent and
an individual that emigrates has a preference that is a function of
the state of each site. The state of each site is driven by the number
of resources available and the number of predators in each site. Thus,
the migration probability of a species $k_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ in
metacommunity $\mathcal{\phi}$ from site $j$ to site $i$ is defined as
the difference between the number of individuals of species that are
prey and species that are predators of species $k_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ in
site $i$. This leads to the dispersal rate of species
$k_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ in metacommunity $\mathcal{\phi}$ from site $j$
to site $i$

%\begin{equation}
%  m^{k_{\phi}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathcal{K}^{k_{\phi}}_{i} m_{\phi} \mathcal{M}^{k_{\phi}}_{j}}{d_{ij}},
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  m^{k_{\phi}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathcal{K}^{k_{\phi}}_{i} m_{\phi}}{d_{ij}} \mathcal{M}^{k_{\phi}}_{j} \frac{\Delta F^{k\phi}_{ij}}{\sum_{n}^{Neigh(j)}\Delta F^{k\phi}_{nj}},
\end{equation}


where, as in Model 1, $\mathcal{K}^{k_{\phi}}_{i}$, $m_{\phi}$, $d_{ij}$ are
the carrying capacity of the receiving site $i$ of metacommunity $\phi$, the
background emigration rate of metacommunity $\phi$, and the geographical
effective distance between site $j$ and site $i$, respectively. 

To take into account informed landscapes we introduce the concepts of mobility
probability and the preference of a species a site. The mobility probability of
species $k$ from site $j$, $\mathcal{M}^{k_{\phi}}_{j}$, is defined as 1 -
$\frac{r^{k_{\phi}}_{j}}{r^{max_{\phi}}_{j}}$ where $r^{k_{\phi}}_{j}$ and
$r^{max_{\phi}}_{j}$ are the reproductive success of species $k$ and the
maximum reproductive success in metacommunity $\phi$ in site $j$, respectively.
If individuals of species $k$ were able to know their reproductive success in
any site, then they would have information to decide where to go to increase
their reproductive success. For example, if species $k$ reproduces in site $j$
better than in any other site (high $r^{k_{\phi}}_{j}$), then individuals of
species $k$ prefer to stay in site $j$, thus the mobility probability is close
to zero.

The preference of a species $k$ for a site $j$, $F^{k\phi}_{i}$, represents how
good the biotic conditions of $j$ are for species $k$, and is given by the
difference in the abundance of prey and the abundance of predators of $k$ in
$j$, $p^{k\phi}_{j}
- P^{k\phi}_{j}$.  The higher is the difference between the preference of a
  species $k$ for a site $j$ and its preferences for a site $j$, $\Delta
F^{k\phi}_{ij}$, ther higher is its probability to move from $j$ to $i$.

Given the dispersal rate, the number of individuals of species $k$ in
metacommunity $\phi$ that move from site $j$ to site $i$ is
\begin{equation}
  N^{k_{\phi}}_{ij} =  m^{k_{\phi}}_{ij}  N^{k_{\phi}}_{j},
\end{equation}
where $N^{k_{\phi}}_{j}$ is the abundance of species $k$ in site $j$.

is the metacommunity-specific background dispersal rate (we need here
a figure with the landscape considered and we also need to simplify
the flow chart and explain this model). The migration of a species
$k_{\mathcal{\phi}}$ from site $j$ to a neighborhood site $i$ occurs
only if $m_{j}^k(t) > m_{i}^k(t)$. The number of individuals of
species $k$ that move from $i$ to $j$ must respect the threshold
imposed by the carrying capacity of the target patch ($cc_j^k(t)$) and
is defined as seen below:

\subsubsection{Model 3: Predator-prey ratio dispersal dynamics in informed and niche-driven landscapes}


\subsection{Demographic dynamics}

In the previous section we have described the dispersal dynamics. Here
we describe the birth and death probabilities associated with each model...

\subsubsection{Model 1: Dispersal dynamics in non-informed landscapes}

At each time (specify the MC rate) we leave all the individuals of
each site $i$ to be choosen by a \emph{Multinomial Distribution}
\cite{levin1981representation}. The chosen individuals can have
three different behaviors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item it can die for natural reasons;
\item it can eat one individual among its prey; 
\item if $k$ have eaten an individual among its prey, so it can give an offspring. 
\end{enumerate}

Individuals from metacommunity $R$ are assumed to have infinity food suply, so
the only possible behaviors are 1. and 2.. 

For each MC time-step $mc$, this simulation is repeated for all individuals of
each patch of the landscape. The births will occur only if there is free space
in the patch $i$, that means, if the number of individuals alive at $i$ is
lower than its carrying capacity ($cc$). For each time $t$ in which one
individual of species $k$ gives an offspring in a patch $i$, its number of
individuals in this patch will be increased by 1; for each time $t$ in which
one individual of species $k$ dies naturally or by predation in a patch $i$,
its number of individuals will be decreased by 1. In Figure \ref{fig:Fluxogram}
we show a fluxogram that summarizes the running of the predation dynamic of the
model.

We consider several spatial configurations. We start with a

nearest 4-neighborhoods.

\subsection{Multi-trophic metacommunity dynamics}

Here, we describe the equations that combine dispersal, trophic and
population dynamics across multiple sites and trophic levels in a
broad geographic region. We track demography and species abundances in
each site by considering at each time step birth-death events across
all the sites.

%The new individual can be of the same species as the dead individual

\subsection{Spatial patterns of ecological and spatial networks}


\subsubsection{Simulations}

We use a Monte Carlo (MC) approach to simulate the dispersal and
predation dynamics. Sites are represented as nodes of a geographical
neighborhood network and the connectivity of those sites are
represented as edges of this network (refs). Trophic relationships
among species within each site are represented by a directed network
in which each node represents a species and each directed link
represents a trophic relationship between a pair of species.

Define background emigration rate and the values explored
Define carrying capacity used, equal or different across sites.

%\subsection{Dispersal Migration}

%The model allows the Dispersal Migration of individuals living in any
%patche $i$ to each patch in its neighborhood.  Is
%assumed that, for each time step, each species in the landscape has a
%level of preference to each patch. The preference of a species $k$ for
%a patch $i$ in time $t$ ($Pref_{i}^k(t)$) is defined as the difference
%between the number of individuals of species that are prey and species
%that are predators of $k$ in that patch. The migration of a species
%$k$ from a patch $i$ to a neighborhood patch $j$ will occur only if
%$Pref_{j}^k(t) > Pref_{i}^k(t)$. The number of individuals of species
%$k$ that move from $i$ to $j$ must respect the threshold imposed by
%the carrying capacity of the target patch ($cc_j^k(t)$) and is defined
%as seen below:
